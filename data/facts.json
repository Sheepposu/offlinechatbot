["Semen, also known as seminal fluid, is an organic fluid created to contain spermatozoa", " Semen is secreted by the gonads (sexual glands) and other sexual organs of male or hermaphroditic animals and can fertilize the female ovum", " In humans, semen contains several components besides spermatozoa: proteolytic and other enzymes as well as fructose are elements of seminal fluid which promote the survival of spermatozoa, and provide a medium through which they can move or \"swim\"", " Semen is produced and originates from the seminal vesicle, which is located in the pelvis", " The process that results in the discharge of semen is called ejaculation", " Semen is a form of genetic material", " In animals, semen has been collected for cryoconservation. Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources is a practice that calls for the collection of genetic material in efforts for conservation of a particular breed", " During the process of ejaculation, sperm passes through the ejaculatory ducts and mixes with fluids from the seminal vesicles, the prostate, and the bulbourethral glands to form the semen", " The seminal vesicles produce a yellowish viscous fluid rich in fructose and other substances that makes up about 70% of human semen", " The prostatic secretion, influenced by dihydrotestosterone, is a whitish (sometimes clear), thin fluid containing proteolytic enzymes, citric acid, acid phosphatase and lipids", " The bulbourethral glands secrete a clear secretion into the lumen of the urethra to lubricate it", " Sertoli cells, which nurture and support developing spermatocytes, secrete a fluid into seminiferous tubules that helps transport sperm to the genital ducts", " The ductuli efferentes possess cuboidal cells with microvilli and lysosomal granules that modify the ductal fluid by reabsorbing some fluid", " Once the semen enters the ductus epididymis the principal cells, which contain pinocytotic vessels indicating fluid reabsorption, secrete glycerophosphocholine which most likely inhibits premature capacitation", " The accessory genital ducts, the seminal vesicle, prostate glands, and the bulbourethral glands, produce most of the seminal fluid", " Seminal plasma of humans contains a complex range of organic and inorganic constituents", " The seminal plasma provides a nutritive and protective medium for the spermatozoa during their journey through the female reproductive tract", " Basic amines such as putrescine, spermine, spermidine and cadaverine are responsible for the smell and flavor of semen", " Semen is typically translucent with white, grey or even yellowish tint", " Blood in the semen can cause a pink or reddish colour, known as hematospermia, and may indicate a medical problem which should be evaluated by a doctor if the symptom persists", " After ejaculation, the latter part of the ejaculated semen coagulates immediately, forming globules, while the earlier part of the ejaculate typically does not", " After a period typically ranging from 15 to 30 minutes, prostate-specific antigen present in the semen causes the decoagulation of the seminal coagulum", " A 2005 review found that the average reported viscosity of human semen in the literature was 3â€“7 cP"]
